\description{
Kinematic viscosity is the ratio of - absolute (or dynamic) viscosity
to density - a quantity in which no force is involved.
The kinematic viscosity ν is simply the dynamic viscosity μ
divided by the fluid density ρ.
The units of μ are pascals-seconds (kg/m.s) vs. the units of ν which are m2/s.

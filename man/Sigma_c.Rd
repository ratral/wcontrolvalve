\usage{
Sigma_c(x, b, d, e, fls)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{valve position}

\item{b}{steepness}

\item{d}{upper value}

\item{e}{the effective dose}

\item{fls}{liquid pressure recovery full open (max between fl and Flp/Fp)}
}
\value{
Sigma_c
}
\description{
An early level of cavitation characterized by mild,
steady popping or crackling sounds that may be audible or detected by
vibration measurements. It is the next higher inflection point on the
cavitation profile above the point of incipient cavitation.
 - More regular cavitation events
 - Lower frequency sound and vibration sensed: “rumbling” sound
 - Some damage to surfaces may occur: dependent upon valve and trim styles, and materials.

\title{Fp Piping geometry factor}
\usage{
fp(kv, dn, d1, d2)
}
\arguments{
\item{kv}{Flow coefficient in mÂ³/h}

\item{dn}{diameter in meter (mm).}

\item{d1}{Inlet diameter reducer only in meter (mm).}

\item{d2}{Outlet diameter increase only in meter (mm).}
}
\value{
Fp Piping geometry factor, dimensionless
}
\description{
The piping geometry factor Fp accounts for fittings attached to
either the valve inlet or the outlet that disturb the flow to the extent that
valve capacity is affected. Fp is actually the ratio of the flow coefficient
of a valve with attached fittings to the flow coefficient (kv) of a valve
installed in a straight pipe of the same size as the valve.
